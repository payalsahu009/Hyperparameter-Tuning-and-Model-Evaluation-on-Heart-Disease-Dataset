# Hyperparameter-Tuning-and-Model-Evaluation-on-Heart-Disease-Dataset
Developed a model to study and preprocess the heart disease dataset. It evaluates four classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Logistic Regression) for accuracy and employs cross-validation to assess model robustness. Carried out hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search and Randomized Search.
